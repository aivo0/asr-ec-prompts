You will receive a sequence of ASR transcript segments from the same recording.
Produce a very short context summary (under 80 words) that helps downstream correction:
- Identify the type of recording (e.g., interview, meeting, podcast)
- Describe conversation style (formal/informal, multi-speaker, host/guest, etc.)
- List the main topics/themes (compact, comma-separated)
- Do not include names unless clearly central; do not quote long text; avoid speculation.

Respond with a single concise paragraph, no markdown, no bullet points.
